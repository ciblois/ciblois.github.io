I have a MSc. in Physics and I am completing a PhD in materials engineering. I have always worked with nanotechnology in the experimental area. I have already synthesized pristine and doped graphene, nanomaterials based on titania and I have used several techniques for characterizing films and particles. I have a great background of data analysis, graphs, LaTeX and reports of experiments. However, I want to enter in the field of data analytics or data science. For this, I have been studying statistical data analysis with SPSS and started online courses in Python. My academic background together with programming is an excellent combination to develop this career and I hope to get you into the job market as soon as possible.
